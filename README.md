**Auto-Doc** is a powerful yet simple VS Code extension designed for developers who need to keep a running diary of their work. It silently monitors your file saves, intelligently detects changes, and appends a detailed, line-by-line log to a Markdown file in your project.



## Why Auto-Doc?

In a fast-paced development environment, documenting every small change is tedious and often forgotten. Auto-Doc solves this by integrating documentation directly into your natural workflow. Never again forget why you removed a block of code or what you added during a late-night coding session.
